      description: |
        Data on imports and exports of Scotland to different countries in the year 1780.
        Unlike the other countries considered in the book, Playfair did not have time series data on Scotland.
        Thus, he presented the data for imports and exports from all countries with the first incidence of a bar chart on Plate XXVI.

        Data on the area and population of the states and territories of the United States of America in 1800.

        This is the data used to make the pie chart of the area of US states and territories in 1800 in the *Statistical Account of the United States of America* (1805).
        The data largely comes from the Table on page 20 of the work, with some rounding of areas and addition of the area of "East and West Florida" and the "Western Territories".
