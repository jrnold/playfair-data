      title: Imports and Exports of Scotland in 1780
      description: |
        Data on imports and exports of Scotland to different countries in the year 1780.
        Unlike the other countries considered in the book, Playfair did not have time series data on Scotland.
        Thus, he presented the data for imports and exports from all countries with the first incidence of a bar chart on Plate XXVI.
